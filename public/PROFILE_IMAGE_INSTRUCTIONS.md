# Profile Image Setup

To display your profile picture on the website:

1. Save your profile photo as `profile.jpg`
2. Place it in this directory: `portfolio-website/public/`
3. The image should be:
   - Square aspect ratio (recommended)
   - At least 400x400 pixels
   - JPG, PNG, or WebP format

The file path should be: `portfolio-website/public/profile.jpg`

Once added, the image will automatically appear on the Hero section with animations.
