### ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

#### Screen Reader Testing (Manual)
To test with screen readers:

**macOS (VoiceOver):**
```bash
# Enable VoiceOver: Cmd + F5
# Navigate: Control + Option + Arrow keys
# Interact: Control + Option + Space
```

**Windows (NVDA):**
```bash
# Download NVDA from https://www.nvaccess.org/
# Navigate: Arrow keys
# Interact: Enter
```

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Navigate through all sections using Tab key
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements are reachable
- [ ] Confirm all links and buttons have descriptive labels
- [ ] Check that heading hierarchy makes sense when read aloud
- [ ] Verify skip to main content link works
- [ ] Test mobile menu with keyboard (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Confirm achievement/certification cards are keyboard accessible

#### Automated Testing
Run these commands to verify accessibility:

```bash
# Install axe-core for automated testing
cd portfolio-website
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/react

# Or use browser extensions:
# - axe DevTools (Chrome/Firefox)
# - WAVE (Chrome/Firefox)
# - Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)
```

#### Color Contrast Testing
- [ ] Use Chrome DevTools Lighthouse audit
- [ ] Use WebAIM Contrast Checker: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
- [ ] Test in different lighting conditions

#### Keyboard Navigation Testing
- [ ] Tab through entire page without using mouse
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Test with different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Verify no keyboard traps exist
